# @agentick/shared

## 0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4750f5e: Tool call summaries and file confirmation with diff preview.

  Tools can define `displaySummary` to provide a short description (e.g., file
  path, command) that appears in stream events and TUI indicators.

  File modification tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`) now require confirmation
  before execution. A new `confirmationPreview` hook computes a unified diff
  that renders in the TUI confirmation prompt.

  Fixed: session confirmation channel wiring (was previously unconnected).
